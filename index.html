      <br>
     Harlem native A$AP Ferg has no problem making his presence known. As a member of hip-hop group A$AP Mob, Ferg is often in the company of rap giants such as A$AP Rocky, but he stands out with his distinctive deep vocals and fast flow that he pairs with hard-hitting trap beats. Ferg is a powerful figure, and he knows it, as evidenced in the title of his 2013 debut album <em>Trap Lord</em>. Despite the sheer confidence Ferg exudes, he constantly aims to elevate his game, embodying the A$AP Mob’s motto, “Always Strive and Prosper.” 
     <br>
     <strong>Why you should get hyped:</strong>
     <br>
     Two words: mosh pit. If there’s one thing A$AP Ferg knows how to do, it’s deliver a high-energy performance. His discography consists of banger after banger, and whether you’re a die-hard A$AP Mob stan or you didn’t even realize until just now that “A$AP” doesn’t stand for “as soon as possible,” it won’t be difficult for you to jump into the packed crowd and scream at the top of your lungs. Get ready to secure your valuables and go crazy.

     <p>The name "Wildcats" was bestowed upon the university in 1924 by a writer for the Chicago Tribune who wrote that even in a loss to the University of Chicago Maroons, the Northwestern football players looked like "Wildcats [that] had come down from Evanston." The name was so popular that university board members made "Wildcats" the official nickname just months later.</p>
