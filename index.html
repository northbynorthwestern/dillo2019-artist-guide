        <br>
        <strong>Why you should get hyped:</strong>
        <br>

        <strong>Lyrics to memorize: </strong>
        <br>
        <br>
        (From “303")
        <br>
        <br>
        "Well this looks like a job for me
       <br> 
       So everybody, just follow me
        <br>
        If you wanna get a little tipsy
        <br>
        We can dance to the beat of the 303
        <br>
        We can dance to the beat of the 303"

        <br>
        <br>
        (One good thing about EDM, though, is that you don’t necessarily need to know any lyrics - it’s the beat drops you’ll remember.)

    <p> <strong>Artist Bio:</strong>
      <br>
      Harlem native A$AP Ferg has no problem making his presence known. As a member of hip-hop group A$AP Mob, Ferg is often in the company of rap giants such as A$AP Rocky (as evidenced by their stage names), but he stands out with his distinctive deep vocals and fast flow that he pairs with hard-hitting trap beats. Ferg is a powerful figure, and he knows it, as seen in the title of his 2013 debut album <em>Trap Lord</em>. Despite the sheer confidence Ferg exudes, he constantly aims to elevate his game, embodying the A$AP Mob’s motto, “Always Strive and Prosper.”  
     <br>
     <strong>Why you should get hyped:</strong>
     <br>
     Two words: mosh pit. If there’s one thing A$AP Ferg knows how to do, it’s delivering a high-energy performance. His discography consists of banger after banger, and whether you’re a die-hard A$AP Mob stan or you didn’t even realize until just now that “A$AP” doesn’t stand for “as soon as possible,” it won’t be difficult for you to jump into the packed crowd and scream at the top of your lungs. Get ready to secure your valuables and go crazy.

    <p> <strong>Artist Bio:</strong>
      <br>
      Indie-rock band Hippo Campus was formed around 2013 in Saint Paul, Minnesota, where the members attended the same performing arts high school. They released their first EP, <em>Bashful Creatures</em>, independently in 2014, then went on sign with a record label. Since then, they’ve released more EPs, two full length albums (<em>Landmark</em> in 2017 and <em>Bambi</em> in 2018) and have toured the world, including performances at South by Southwest, Bonnaroo and Chicago’s own Lollapalooza. And, after years of being a highly requested group, Hippo Campus will finally grace the Dillo Mainstage!

     <br>
     <strong>Why you should get hyped:</strong>
     <br>
     They’re up-and-coming. Historically, Dillo has done a really good job of catching artists before they make it big. Although they’ve been around for a while, Hippo Campus is getting mainstream success and critical acclaim with <em>Bambi</em>. Expect them to bring great energy and uptempo indie bops to your early Dillo afternoon. If their performance is anything like their 2017 Minnesota State Fair performance (this author was there), it’s sure to be a BLAST.

    (She’ll be fine on her own, she'll be fine on her own)

      <br>
      Yeah, swing, sucker, swing, finish sobbing
      <br>

      (You gotta know the refrain to this bad boy, but the second section is also the hypest part of the song.)

   <p> <strong>Artist Bio:</strong>
     <br>
     The one and only Teyana Taylor is a triple threat (singer, dancer, actress) from Harlem, New York. She’s the leading lady of Kanye West’s G.O.O.D. Music record label, from which she released her debut album <em>VII</em> in 2014. She’s worked and written records with Usher, Chris Brown, and Omarion and walked runways at New York Fashion Week. Her most recent album <em>K.T.S.E.</em> (Keep That Same Energy), was one of last year’s best R&B albums.


    <br>
    <strong>Why you should get hyped:</strong>
    <br>
    Teyana’s is performance is guaranteed to wow you with some amazing choreography (she was the star of Kanye’s 2016 “Fade” music video, and she’s choreographed for Beyoncé.) She has a soulful, raspy voice and throwback R&B vibes that will chill you out and lift you up you at the same. Plus, she and A$AP Ferg are both Harlem natives, and their parallel journeys and styles complement each other.

   <p> <strong>Artist Bio:</strong>
     <br>
     From Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, Daya entered and quickly became a star in the music industry at just 16 years old. In 2015, she released her first song “Hide Away,” which peaked at number 23 on the Billboard Top 100. In 2016, she released a self-titled EP <em>Daya</em>, which features the second song that skyrocketed her to fame, “Sit Still, Look Pretty.” In 2017, just two years after being in the industry, she won a Grammy for Best Dance Record for her song “Don’t Let Me Down” with The Chainsmokers.


    <br>
    <strong>Why you should get hyped:</strong>
    <br>
    Daya performed at the White House Easter Egg Hunt in 2016 and met the Obamas — that should be enough of a claim to fame. In case that fact isn’t, her promoter Steve Zap founded his own recording label Artbeatz just to endorse her. Daya’s lyrics are fun and playful, and being as old as the average sophomore at Northwestern, she’s just like us (if we won Grammys at the age of 18).

   But this gal right here's gonna rule the world
    <br>
    Yeah, that is where I'm gonna be because I wanna be

    <br>
    No, I don't wanna sit still, look pretty


    <br>
    You get off on your nine to five


    <br>
    Dream of picket fences and trophy wives


    <br>
    But no, I'm never gonna be 'cause I don't wanna be

    No, I don't wanna sit still look pretty"
